Props & State 
----------------

-> porps -> send data from one component to another component (parent an child component)

 <ParentCard>
 ......

 <ChildCard namd="Musab" age="45" />  if it's class base compoent we use props as -> this.props.name to access the props data and if it's function base compoent we use onle -> props.name
 </ParentCard>

 -> props object will look like 

 props ={
    name:'Musab',
    age:45
 };


 -> State -> is used to mange data within component itself
